# widgy-lastfm
The backend to show your Top 9 from Last.fm in Widgy (iOS Widget App).

This is a simple RSS feed that pulls the album covers of your Top 9 albums (for the last week) from Last.fm. I use it with the [iOS Widgy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgy/id1524540481) app to display my most listened to albums in a little widget on my home screen. 

This is the [Widgy widget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7143532/149642217-2bd72ba8-c13a-480b-b8f6-5a393eb9bc09.jpeg) I created, you'll want to change the RSS image endpoint to your version of this script using your own API key and username.
