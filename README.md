# widgy-lastfm
The backend to show your Top 9 from Last.fm in Widgy (iOS Widget App).

This is a simple RSS feed that pulls the album covers of your Top 9 albums (for the last week) from Last.fm. I use it with the [iOS Widgy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgy/id1524540481) app to display my most listened to albums in a little widget on my home screen. 

This is the [Widgy widget](widgyURL://widgy.icu/api/v1/widgy/955d86ed-2a88-4134-a201-f9252d078020) I created, you'll want to change the RSS image endpoint to your version of this script using your own API key and username.
